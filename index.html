    The console is a commonly used attribute in large scale websites, it is mainly used to show errors and server information to the coders. Top open the console, right click the website and click the "Inspect" option. After doing so, click on console at the top of the screen. When using Javascript, you can make different items (these can be strings or numbers) to be seen, to do so, you have to use: console.log() and in the brackets you must use a variable name, and it will display the value inside of the variable.
